# seven_continents
## Overview
This software searches for optimal solutions for a variant of the [Traveling Salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). It was written to help me find the shortest path between all seven continents while obeying a number of mission constraints, such as:
* Aircraft range and performance
* Airport size
* Runway type, length, surface material, and restrictions
* [US State Department Travel Advisories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html)
* Winds aloft

The first time the program is run, it will analyze the supplied mission constraints and build a cache of distances between each valid airport. This can take several minutes and consume a few hundred MB of disk space, but it makes the actual search algorithm over 10x faster.

After the cache is built (or after a previously built cache is loaded from disk), the search algorithm starts by hashing airports into buckets based on their latitude and longitude. The first search pass treats all airports in the same hash bucket as a single airport which substantially reduces the search space. This simplified search is run randomly a certain number of times.

Then, the top 20 routes are optimized with a more expensive but more exhaustive search. It looks at each airport along the top routes and examines whether the other airports in the same hash bucket would lead to a faster overall route. This generally results in around a 0.5% - 2.5% improvement in overall route length and only takes a few seconds.

There are many other ways to solve this problem. This algorithm is not the fastest or the most optimal. I simply wanted something that would run in under an hour and produce reasonably good results. On my laptop it takes about 40 minutes to search 100 million possible routes, and it seems like this is already beyond the point of diminishing returns. Running the search for 10x as long often produces routes only about 1-2% better.

Lastly, the modeling used for aircraft performance, flight profiles, and weather is extremely simplistic. This enables faster searching but yield less accurate results. I sent some of my top routes to a professional flight department to be benchmarked and found that my simple modeling led to only ~2.5% error for a ~40 hour route. Better modeling would certainly improve the error, but it would likely be slower.

## Sample Usage

To force the search to start with an airport from Antarctica and then go to one in South America:

```python seven_continents.py --start-from-continent-codes AN,SA```

To fix the first three airports to KOAK, SBGL, and FACT:

```python seven_continents.py --start-from-airport-codes KOAK,SBGL,FACT```

## Sample Output
An HTML report is generated for analyzing the results. The top routes are listed and visualized using the Google Maps API. You can view a full sample report [here](results/sample/sample.html). Included in the report are images like this:
